Setup a React app
Render an App component
  App should be in its own file
App should render 5 <Joke /> components
  Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a punchline prop
  and render those hoever you'd like

EXTRA CREDIT:
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
  E.g.: "It's hard to explain puns to kleptomantics because they always take things literally."
If you don't pass in a "question" how might you make it only show the punchline instead?

Spend time practicing the style of your content.

Installing React and ReactDOM
We have a directory to hold our project. Now we install React and ReactDOM. Type `yarn add react react-dom`. The add subcommand installs a module in the current project. You can specify more than one module by separating them with a space. Here, we are installing react and react-dom.
